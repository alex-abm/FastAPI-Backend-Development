# FastAPI-Backend-Development


In this assignment, we will finalize the implementation of a FastAPI backend server. The project structure is already set up, and our task is to complete the remaining components to ensure full functionality. The application stores event data in a JSON file instead of a database, and we will be implementing various API endpoints to manage these events.  

Key tasks include updating the Event model, creating a file storage system for reading and writing events, and implementing API routes for retrieving, filtering, creating, updating, and deleting events. Additionally, we will develop a feature to analyze attendees who have participated in multiple events. The goal is to build a fully operational backend while enhancing our Python and FastAPI skills. Testing and validation of API functionality are crucial, and resources are provided to assist with cloning, running, and debugging the project.
